The objective of a Climate Change Dashboard is to provide a centralized, real-time platform that enables users to monitor,
analyze, and visualize key climate data and trends. By tracking essential indicators such as temperature changes the dashboard help
stakeholders better understand the impacts of climate change. It also allows for the tracking of mitigation and adaptation efforts, 
such as climate resilience projects, ensuring that interventions are on track.
Designed to support informed decision-making, the dashboard offers actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and the public,
fostering greater awareness, accountability, and collaboration. Ultimately, the dashboard serves as a tool to promote 
data-driven actions that mitigate climate risks and enhance global climate resilience.

||**Result summary**||
The image depicts a section of a climate change dashboard hosted on an interactive web application. At the top, there is a dropdown menu labeled
"Select Year for Top 10 Hottest Countries," with the year 1988 selected. Below the dropdown is a green button labeled "Generate Top 10 Hottest Countries Chart."
The main content of the dashboard is a bar chart titled "Top 10 Hottest Countries in 1988." The chart showcases the temperature changes (in °C) for the top 10
countries that experienced the highest temperatures during that year. Tunisia, Algeria, and Canada are among the top three, with temperature changes exceeding 1.2°C
, while other countries, including Malta, Libya, and Australia, follow closely. The chart uses orange bars to represent the data visually, with the x-axis listing the 
countries and the y-axis showing the temperature change values.

The image shows another section of the Climate Change Dashboard. At the top, it features input options to select a start year, an end year, and a country for analysis. 
The start year is set to 1961, the end year to 2022, and the selected country is Bhutan. A blue button labeled "Generate Temperature Plot" allows users to create a visual
representation of the data. Below these inputs, there is a line graph titled "Temperature Change for Bhutan (1961–2022)." The graph displays annual temperature change trends 
in Bhutan over the selected period. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis indicates the temperature changes in degrees Celsius (°C). The line chart, drawn in blue,
shows a general upward trend, signifying an increase in temperature change over time.
